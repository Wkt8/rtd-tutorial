Accession Numbers
=================

Submissions to BioSamples result in accession numbers. These are a unique set of characters that identify each sample.

BioSample accessions always begin with SAM. The next letter is either E or N or D depending if the sample information was originally submitted to EMBL-EBI or NCBI or DDBJ respectively. After that, there may be an A or a G to denote an Assay sample or a Group of samples. Finally there is a numeric component that may or may not be zero-padded.

Understanding these accessions can give you some information about what they refer to, even before you find them in our browser. For example, in the case of studies, samples, experiments, runs and analyses, you can identify which INSDC partner accepted the original submission by looking at the first letter: ‘E’ for ENA, ‘D’ for DDBJ, or ‘S’ for NCBI.
