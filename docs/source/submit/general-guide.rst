General Guide to BioSamples Sample Registration
==============================================
Welcome to the general guide for BioSamples sample registration. Please take a moment to view this introduction and familiarize yourself with the options available to you before you begin registering your samples. 

BioSamples allows sample registration via two routes, each of which is appropriate for a different set of users and submission types. 

Interactive File Uploads involve logging into BioSamples, downloading template ISA-TAB (tsv) spreadsheets that can be completed off-line and uploaded to BioSamples. This is often the most accessible route. 
Programmatic Submissions involve preparing your submissions as JSON files before submitting them to BioSamples to the JSON API

- BioSamples also allows a variety of other features, including 
- Updating existing samples (hyperlink)
- Obtaining private accessions prior to sample registration (hyperlink)
- Validating Samples using the JSON API (hyperlink)

The interactive file upload service is recommended, unless you are already familiar with programmatic submissions. 

This general guide will get you started in understanding how to register your samples to ENA, and how to keep track of the progress of your submission.
